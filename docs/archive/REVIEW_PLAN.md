## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies:
- TASK-01 → TASK-06, TASK-09 (API integration must be complete before full implementation)
- TASK-03 → TASK-10 (Tests must be fixed before adding more integration tests)
- TASK-02 → TASK-05 (Credentials must be secured before adding production validation)
- TASK-11 → TASK-16 (Security monitoring foundation before performance monitoring)

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. **Week 1-2**: TASK-02, TASK-03, TASK-05, TASK-01, TASK-04
2. **Week 3-4**: TASK-07, TASK-08, TASK-06, TASK-09, TASK-10
3. **Week 5-6**: TASK-11, TASK-12, TASK-13, TASK-14, TASK-15
4. **Week 7-8**: TASK-16, TASK-17, TASK-18, TASK-19, TASK-20, TASK-21, TASK-22

- ✅ Production environment properly validates configuration
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented and tested

### Overall Project Success Criteria:
- ✅ Production-ready security posture
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- ✅ Full API functionality implemented
- ✅ Monitoring and observability in place
- ✅ Documentation complete for maintenance and onboarding

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items:
1. **Database Migration Risks**: Ensure proper backups before schema changes
2. **Authentication Changes**: Test thoroughly to avoid breaking existing sessions
3. **Security Middleware**: Validate in staging before production deployment
4. **External Dependencies**: Verify compatibility before major version updates

### Rollback Plans:
- Database migrations: Include rollback scripts for each change
- API changes: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Security updates: Test in isolated environment first
- Configuration changes: Version control all environment files

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team:
- Backend Developer (Full-time): API implementation, security, database
- Frontend Developer (Part-time): Integration with backend changes
- DevOps Engineer (Part-time): CI/CD, monitoring, deployment
- QA Engineer (Part-time): Test automation, validation

### Tools & Services:
- APM monitoring service (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)
- Security scanning tools (Snyk, OWASP ZAP)
- Load testing platform (k6 Cloud, Artillery)
- Documentation hosting (ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages)

This plan provides a structured approach to addressing all identified issues while maintaining project velocity and ensuring production readiness.
