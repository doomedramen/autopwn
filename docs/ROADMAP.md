3. User receives notification of new captures
4. User can immediately create cracking jobs from web interface
5. Results available without any manual file handling

**Implementation Details:**

**API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/v1/captures/upload-via-api
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
  "file": <pcap-file>,
  "device_id": "pwnagotchi-01" (optional),
  "metadata": {
    "captured_at": "2025-01-19T12:00:00Z",
    "location": "lat,lng" (optional)
  }
}
```

**Python Plugin:**
Location: `apps/pwnagotchi-plugin/autopwn_uploader.py`

Features:
- Single-file Python script
- Configurable URL and API key
- Automatic PCAP detection
- Upload queue for reliability
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Progress feedback
- Minimal dependencies (requests library only)

**User Workflow:**
1. Generate API key in autopwn web interface
2. Install plugin on Pwnagotchi
3. Configure plugin with autopwn URL and API key
4. Plugin auto-uploads new handshakes when online
