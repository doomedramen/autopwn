### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the existing code style**:
   - TypeScript for all new code
   - ESM modules (not CommonJS)
   - Functional components for React
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
3. **Test your changes**:
   - Test locally with `npm run dev:worker` and `npm run dev:web`
   - Test Docker build with `docker-compose build`
   - Ensure existing functionality still works
4. **Write clear commit messages**:
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - First line: brief summary (50 chars or less)
   - Detailed description if needed
5. **Update documentation** if you change functionality
6. **Submit the pull request**

## Development Setup

### Coding Guidelines

**TypeScript**
- Use strict type checking
- Avoid `any` types
- Export interfaces from `packages/shared/src/types.ts`

**React Components**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

**Styling**
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Keep consistent dark theme (gray-900, gray-800)
- Maintain responsive design

**Database**
- All schema changes go in `packages/shared/src/schema.ts`
- Update types in `packages/shared/src/types.ts`
- Use WAL mode for SQLite
- Test with concurrent reads/writes
